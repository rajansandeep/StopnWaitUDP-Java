# StopnWaitUDP-Java
This project implements a distributed networking application in Java, consisting of a transmitter and a receiver which communicate using the Stop-and-Wait RDT protocol over Javaâ€™s UDP sockets.


Testing the functionality of this project:

 There are three java classes - StopAndWaitTransmitter, StopAndWaitReceiver and RC4. To test the functionality of the project, the RC4 class has to be included in both the transmitter as well as receiver packages. 
 First, run the Receiver class and then the Transmitter class.
